# Task 2 : Styling with Inline CSS

This project is part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The focus of Task 2 is to apply basic inline CSS styles directly within HTML elements. By doing so, the project demonstrates how CSS can influence the appearance of web content without using external stylesheets.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The objective of this task is to :
- Understand the fundamentals of CSS.
- Apply basic styling inline within HTML elements.
- Experiment with different CSS properties to see their impact on font color, size, and background color.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5 :** The base structure for the webpage.
- **Inline CSS :** CSS applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.
- **Flexbox :** For layout management to align and center content.

## 🎯 Features
- **Inline CSS :** CSS styles are directly applied to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
- **Font and Color Changes :** Modifications to font color, background color, and font size.
